TaSMET is a computer code that is able to simulate thermoacoustic (TA) and Stirling systems. TaSMET provides nonlinear models to simulate laminar oscillating flow in ducts, heat exchangers, stacks and pistons. These nonlinear models can be connected to form a model of a complete TA or Stirling system.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
