Thermoacoustic System Modeling Environment Twente

Welcome to TaSMET, the Thermoacoustic System Modeling Environment Twente. TaSMET is a computer code that is able to simulate thermoacoustic and Stirling systems. Currently, models are provided to simulate laminar flow ducts, heat exchangers, stacks and pistons. In the near future, we hope to expand the capabilities of TaSMET to porous media and stacked-=screen regenerators, and turbulent flow ducts.
