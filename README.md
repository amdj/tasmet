# TaSMET
Thermoacoustic System Modeling Environment Twente

Welcome to TaSMET, the Thermoacoustic System Modeling Environment Twente. TaSMET is a computer code that is able to simulate thermoacoustic and Stirling systems. Currently, models are provided to simulate laminar flow ducts, heat exchangers, stacks and pistons. In the near future, we hope to expand the capabilities of TaSMET to porous media and stacked-=screen regenerators, and turbulent flow ducts.

## Prerequisites
### Linux
The following packages are assumed to be available:
- Git (to clone the repository)
- SuperLU
- Armadillo (the linear algebra package used) >= 5.0 as we use the SuperLU solver from within Armadillo
- Python or IPython (preferrably IPython notebook)
- In the future: Qt4 libraries for a small GUI

### Windows
At this point, I have not done any testing for windows. The best thing to suggest is to install a linux image in a virtual machine (VM) (i.e. VirtualBox) and install TaSMET in this VM.
