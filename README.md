# TaSMET
Thermoacoustic System Modeling Environment Twente

Welcome to the ThermoAcoustic System Modeling Environment Twente, or
TASMET. TASMET is a computer code to model thermoacoustic (TA)
engines, refrigerators and combined systems by providing nonlinear
models for laminar/turbulent oscillating flow in ducts, heat
exchangers and stacks/regenerators. A coupling to the mechanical and
electrical domain is provided with a piston model.

- For a quick glance on the possibilities of TaSMET, please look into
the User's guide provided with the code.
- For the installation guide, please look into the [Wiki][Wiki]
